# Common `.gitgnore` Templates

A collection of `.gitignore` starter templates that I've successfully used
on other projects, small or large.

These are opinionated and may differ from the standards set by GitHub's
collection over at github/gitignore, so always read through the ignore rules
before applying them to your repositories.

Ignore rules for IDEs are generally not included for framework or
engine-specific files unless they officially support a small set of IDEs, such
as Unreal Engine's support for Visual Studio, Rider, and XCode. (VS Code is
minimally officially supported and is thus excluded.)
